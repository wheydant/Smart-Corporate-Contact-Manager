# Smart Corporate Contract Manager

## Spring Initializer – start.spring.io

1. Group – If project uploaded on maven’s site it needs to be unique, thus we have to follow standard to just reverse the domain name.

2. Artifact – Name of the project.
3.	Dependencies – Not needed to add all the dependencies at once, gradually add them.
    
    -	Spring Web –
    -	Thymeleaf – Our backend is been generated by backend only. We need template engine. To convert Spring Boot server to Dynamic HTML Response.

    - Data JPA – For SQL Database connection.
    - Validation – Bean Validation for Form validation.
    - Spring Security – Will Add later.
    - Outh2-client – Will Add later.
    - Model mapper – Will Add later.
    - Starter mail – Will add later.
    - Lombok – Annotation Library ready to user boiler plates.
    - Dev tools – Live reload.
    - MySQL Driver – For SQL Connection.

## Setup
1. DB 

    i. src > main > resources > application.properties
        
    - url – tool:database:server:port/{db_name} username and password.
    - In SQL create schema > db_name. Columns will be generated by spring boot.

2. JPA
    
    i. ddl-auto – update is mandatory to reflect changes in database.


## Basic Setup

1. @Controller – We need a controller to handle a request. Controller can send dynamic data to HTML page. 
    
    i. This is done by taking Model as controller parameter. Adding any attribute to this model.

    ii.	Extracting Data in HTML is done using thymeleaf data-th-text=”${name}” th stands for thymeleaf and displayed as text or th:href etc data-th- are html friendly code, it will automatically populate that tag where it is mentioned. 

2.	@RequestMapping(“{/url}”) – Makes a handler method which act as a return statement for the controller which usually returns name of the view.

## Configuring Tailwind

    a.	We can use Play CDN but its more for development purpose and not production.

    b.	We have to initialize node in our project using ‘npm init -y’ and add “type” = “module” in package.json. 

    c.	Initialize tailwind by ‘npx tailwindcss init’ in config file add content path where the css content will be present.

    d.	Add input and output css file to catch all the css changes used in our code. This output will be the main file which we would deploy add watch flag to make changes on runtime. ‘npx tailwind -i .\src\main\resources\static\css\input.css -o .\src\main\resources\static\css\output.css –watch’.

    e.	Add stylesheet of output file to insert css in our project  <link rel="stylesheet" data-th-href="@{'/css/output.css'}"/> Thyme leaf href is used with @ specifying relative path.
    
    f.	Using Flowbite for components. 

## [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/layouts.html) 

a.	Fragment
    
    i.	Enables React type of component insertion in main.html in springboot, this react components are known as thymeleaf fragments. 

    ii.	Fragment can take variables and even markups to load individual components.

    iii.	Create a file which contains name of fragment <div class="fragment-tag" th:fragment="parent(x,y)"> , Parameters can be accessed by <h1>Value of x is <span th:text="${x}"></span> </h1>
    
    iv.	Use this fragment in any page. We can either insert or replace in base div.  <div class="host-tag" th:insert="~{base :: parent(one, two)}">, One and two are the parameters passed.

    v.	Markup can be handled using – <div class="host-tag" th:insert="~{base :: parent(~{::section})}">, to pass via id/ class th:replace="~{base :: parent(~{::#main-content})}"/ th:replace="~{base :: parent(~{::.main-content})}"

    vi.	Fetched using <div th:replace="${content}"></div> replace as we don’t want that div instead want to load the fragment.
